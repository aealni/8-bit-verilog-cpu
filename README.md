# Custom 8-bit CPU Architecture

## Overview

This project implements a simple 8-bit CPU in Verilog with a compact instruction set architecture (ISA), 4 general-purpose registers, a central 8-bit RAM, and an ALU supporting three operations. The design primarily uses multiplexer logic within the top-level module to send values.

The CPU fetches instructions from RAM, decodes them, performs ALU or memory operations, and updates its program counter (PC) accordingly. Instructions are executed over multiple clock cycles.

* FSM-based control unit
* Support for immediate values
* Minimal module breakdown

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Each instruction is 8 bits wide.

### ALU Instructions

Use `src1` as the destination.

* Format: `[7:5] opcode | [4] immsel/padding | [3:2] src1 | [1:0] src2_or_imm2`

| Opcode | Mnemonic | Description              |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| 000    | ADD      | src1 = src1 + src2/imm2  |
| 001    | SUB      | src1 = src1 - src2/imm2  |
| 010    | NAND     | src1 = \~(src1 & src2)   |

> Note: `immsel = 1` selects the 2-bit immediate `imm2` instead of `src2`.
> In `NAND`, bit \[4] is reserved as `0` (padding).

### Non-ALU Instructions

Use direct RAM addressing. STORE and LOAD use R0 to read/write.

* Format: `[7:5] opcode | [4:0] address`

| Opcode | Mnemonic | Description                    |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 011    | LOAD     | R0 = RAM\[address]             |
| 100    | STORE    | RAM\[address] = R0             |
| 101    | JMP      | PC = address                   |
| 110    | JZ       | If Zero flag set, PC = address |
| 111    | HALT     | Stop execution                 |

## Modules

Performs ADD, SUB, NAND based on `alu_op`.

* Inputs: `src1`, `src2`, `imm2`, `immsel`, `alu_op`
* Output: `result`, `zero_flag`

### 3. `register_file.v`

4 registers, 8 bits each. R0 is always the destination.

* Outputs: `src1_data`, `src2_data`

### 4. `ram.v`

32 x 8-bit RAM, addressable via 5-bit address.

* Inputs: `clk`, `read_en`, `write_en`, `address`, `write_data`
* Output: `read_data`

### 5. `pc.v`

5-bit Program Counter

* Inputs: `clk`, `reset`, `pc_write`, `next_pc`
* Output: `pc_out`

### 6. `instruction_register.v`

Holds current instruction.

* Inputs: `clk`, `reset`, `load_ir`, `instruction_in`
* Output: `instruction_out`

### 7. `control_unit.v`

Finite State Machine that:

* Decodes opcode
* Generates control signals (see below)

## Architecture

Module inputs and outputs are directly connected, sometimes with MUXs to select an input. The following inputs are decided by MUX logic.

* PC source
* Memory address
* Register write data
* ALU immediate select (integrated into the ALU module)

## Instruction Cycle

1. **Fetch**:

   * PC addresses RAM
   * Load instruction into IR
   * Increment PC unless overwritten (e.g., JMP/JZ)

2. **Decode**:

   * Decode `opcode` from IR
   * Generate all control signals accordingly

3. **Execute**:

   * ALU op â†’ result stored in R0
   * LOAD/STORE interact with RAM
   * JMP/JZ update PC
   * HALT disables PC increment and all control

4. **Memory**:

  * Select IR\[4:0] for RAM address input
  * Enable read on LOAD
  * Enable write on STORE

5. **Writeback**:

  * Set control signals so LOAD always writes to R0
  * Set control signals so ALU operations always write to src1 (IR\[4:3])
---

## Notes

* Immediate values (`imm2`) are zero-extended to 8 bits.
* `R0` acts as the sole source/destination for STORE/LOAD.
* All instructions are 8 bits and execute by performing a single instruction cycle step per clock cycle.
* RAM is dual-use: instruction and data memory. We suggest using addresses after the HALT instruction to store 8 bit data.
* PC always starts at 0 at the start of program execution.
* A reset signal is sent at the start of program execution.
* This project was tested using Intel Quartus Prime Lite 24.1 and ModelSim-Intel Starter Edition 18.1.
